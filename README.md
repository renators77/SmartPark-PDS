# SmartPark-PDS
It is a web page called smart park where the user can see how many spaces are available in each park, resulting in greater parking efficiency.
You also have the possibility of reserving a place in private parks where you can access the park through license plate recognition.
This program was developed for the software development process course, using the programming tools Angular, NestJS, MySQL, Tailwind and TypeScript.
